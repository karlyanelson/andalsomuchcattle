## Created Using Jekyll
[Jekyll] is a static site generator, with great blogging/posting capabilities.

## Responsive Comic Strip Layout
Uses [flex-box] to create a responsive comic strip layout. See [web-comic.css] on Github for more details.

## Comics by Category
Used [this] article to create my Archive page without using any plugins.
Jekyll has some great capabilities using categories/tags.
